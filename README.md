Hi, how you're doing?

I'm ramon and here for to code as well as to make friends in the community of programming.
Whether it is java or mysql. Well, it's definitely obvious what language I prefer.

I just want to be productive,efficient, and learn more about different languages.
However, I need to focus only to one goal. Learn, study, and focus on one language.
Moreover to improve my skills in writing a code.
I like to express what I feel by writing code which i'm comfortable.
